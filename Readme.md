# IoT Challenge 01
## Ayas Nasih - S1600655

I have made a Rock-Paper-Scissors game for Microbit as IoT Challenge 1.
- When you start the Microbit, it will be Player 1's turn to play.
- Shake the Microbit device.
- You will be shown Player 1's result.
- Now it will be Player 2's turn.
- Shake the device again.
- You will be shown Player 2's result and the overall result of the game.
- Restart device for another round if you want.
